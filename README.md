# Spotify-script-to-avoid-ads
simpel script to make spotify open and close which you can use when a ad starts playing. when spotify closes and opens then the ad is gone and you can go back to relaxing your mind.

HOW TO:
1. start with putting the .bat and PowerShell in a folder anywhere safe like C:\Scripts\

2. Go to https://www.autohotkey.com/ and download autohotkey. Its a lightweight system to make hotkeys and simple to use.

3. go to desktop and make a new  AutoHotkey Script. and put a name and select notepad as editer. (or what you would like)

4. copy the script from the .ahk file and check if the routes matches where you put the .ps1 and .bat files (th hotkey is set to f12 but this can ofc be changed)
